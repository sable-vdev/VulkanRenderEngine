Project put on hold to learn DirectX11 first


Project used to learn and create a Render Engine in Vulkan.
Following the tutorial of Alexander Overvoorde (https://vulkan-tutorial.com/)

Dependencies:
vulkan, glfw, glm

If you want to run the project:
Both glm and glfw are in the dependencies folder.
BUT the vulkan sdk in its size is more than 1GB. So you will need to add your own path in the project properties.
